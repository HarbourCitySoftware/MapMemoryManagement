# Map Memory Management

Sample code for a talk given at Sydney CocoaHeads in October 2020 on some common "gotcha's" when working with a MKMapView that's placed within a tab bar of your iOS application. 

Xcode version 12.0 (12A7209) was used for preparing the the sample project for the talk, and for analysing memory usage of MKMapView.
